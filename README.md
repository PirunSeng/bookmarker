Bookmaker is a simple Rails app in which you can find your bookmarks faster.
I find it difficult to go through my bookmarks and find it line by line even I already folded in category folder. That makes me come up an idea to create this simple app for my own, and I think it can be for everyone, you, as well.

To get up and running you will need these dependencies:
* Ruby version 2.3.1
* Rails version 4.2.4
* PostgreSQL 9.2

You are all set.
-> Run "rails s" on your terminal
-> Navigate to your browser with "localhost:3000"

Yeah....enjoy your bookmarkers specialist!
