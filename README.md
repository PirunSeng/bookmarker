FastFinder is a simple Rails app in which you can find your bookmarks faster.
I find it difficult to go through my bookmarks and find it line by line even I already folded in category folder. That makes me come up an idea to create this simple app for my own, and I think it can be for everyone, you, as well.

== README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...


Please feel free to use a different markup language if you do not plan to run
<tt>rake doc:app</tt>.
